# Cortex Rolls

Rolling abilities simulates virtual die rolls to tell you the outcome of challenges.  You can make an open-ended roll:

`roll <ability>`

Or roll against a specific difficulty:

`roll <ability> vs <difficulty>`

Opposed rolls require both parties to make an open-ended roll, and then you can compare the results.

When specifying an ability, you have a couple options:

* An ability name (`roll Strength`)
* Two abilities - typically an attribute and a skill (`roll Strength+Athletics`)
* A die step - handy for NPCs (`roll d6`)
