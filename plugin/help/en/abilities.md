# Cortex Abilities

Cortex has three kinds of abilities:  Attributes, Skills and Traits (which are further divided into Assets and Complications).  Each are rated with a die step - d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d12+d2, etc.  Set any ability to 0 to erase it from your character sheet.

`attributes` - Lists attributes.
`attribute/set <name>=<dice step>` - Sets an attribute.

General skills can only be rated up to d6.  To go higher, you must add one or more specialties.

`skills` - Lists attributes.
`skill/set <name>=<dice step>` - Sets a skill.
`skill/specialty <skill name>/<specialty name>/<dice step>` - Sets a specialty for a skill.

`assets` - Lists attributes.
`asset/set <name>=<dice step>` - Sets an asset.

`complications` - Lists attributes.
`complication/set <name>=<dice step>` - Sets a complication.
  
`reset` - Resets abilities back to starting values.
